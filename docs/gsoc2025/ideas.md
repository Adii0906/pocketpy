### VSCode plugin for debugging pocketpy applications

+ Difficulty Level: 3/5 (Medium)
+ Skill: TypeScript; C
+ Project Length: Small

Community users have reported that there is no convenient way to debug python applications interpreted by pocketpy. Fortunately, VSCode provides a mechanism of [Debugger Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/debugger-extension) that allows us to integrate pocketpy debugger into VSCode UI through Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP).

This project aims to develop a VSCode plugin like [Python Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy), which implements DAP for pocketpy. With this plugin, users can launch their pocketpy applications in VSCode with breakpoints, call stacks, and variable inspection. Students with experience in TypeScript will be helpful for this project.
